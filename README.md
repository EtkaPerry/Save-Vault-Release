Save Vault is an automatic game save backup manager that helps protect your precious game progress from corruption, accidental deletion, or hardware failures.

> **Note:** This is my first C# project. While I've tried to follow best practices, there may be areas for improvement as I continue to learn.
>
> **Alpha Status:** Save Vault is currently in alpha. Many configuration options are exposed to help identify and resolve issues. Some features are still under development.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/Save-Vault-Release/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice
3. Run `SaveVaultApp.exe`

## üîß Usage

2. **Main Interface**: View detected games, customize settings, and manage backups
3. **Game Selection**: Click on a game to see its settings and backup history
4. **Custom Settings**: Toggle custom settings to override global backup configuration
5. **Manual Backup**: Use the "Save Now" button to create an immediate backup
6. **Restore**: Select a backup from history and click "Restore" to revert to that save

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Global Settings

- **Auto-Save Interval**: Default time between automatic backups (15 minutes by default)
- **Maximum Auto-Saves**: Number of automatic backups to keep per game (5 by default)

## üîí Security Notes

Save Vault includes optional cloud sync capabilities, which requires authentication. Your data is:
- Encrypted during transmission using HTTPS
- Protected by JWT token authentication
- Only accessible with your credentials

However, as this is my first C# project, I recommend:
- Using a unique password not shared with critical accounts
- Being cautious with sensitive save data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Save Vault works best with games that store saves in standard locations
- Some games with unusual save mechanisms may not be fully compatible
- Cloud sync requires an internet connection and valid account
- As a alpha product, many features are still in development or may not work as expected
- For a complete list of planned features and known issues, please check the [project board](https://github.com/users/EtkaPerry/projects/6)
